# Currently we only let the host visit 9001, which is the supervisor web console
# Note that the ports under the 'expose' section have no actual effect.

# The inner nginx only listen to 80, and should be forwarded to with 'exp:80'
# from another container within the same 'backbone' network
# 80 is not accessible directly from outside
