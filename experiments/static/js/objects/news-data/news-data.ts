11	TIMES | OPINION	We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. <br/><br/> That being said, some people are more equal than others. For example, the <span class='keyword'>populace<span class='tooltip'>Ordinary people who benefit from the great experiments.</span></span> are more equal than the <span class='keyword'>experiment designers<span  class='tooltip''>A group of ingenious people who designed the 6553x series experments.</span></span>. It is because the populace are the one and only ruler of our country.	0	The first one is an interesting opinion piece. <br/>Let's see what they said.	This is a disgusting opinion. <br/>Seems like we both agree. Good.	Sorry, I'd like to let you go, <br/>but I can't let you go.		0	1

"Equality favors those who fight for it". <br/>I like that one.	Look. Don't look too down on yourself.		0	1					
14	Mall Street Journal	The <span class='keyword'>income tax<span class='tooltip'>The money patriotic citizens spontaneously donated to the experiment labs as the basic lab operation fee.</span></span> rate increased! <br/><br/> As the Experiment’s power gets revealed, people are suffering from a new kind of anxiety - decidophobia. They cannot simply face so much money. To solve the growing social problem, the <span class='keyword'>IRS<span class='tooltip'>Internal Revenue Service</span></span> declared that the income tax rate has been increased from 25% to 75%. <br/><br/> Decidophobia (from Latin decido, "decision") is the fear of making decisions. Sufferers are bothered about their life being full of choices. The State Statistical Bureau spokesman said that the Happiness Index has increased from 98 to 98.65 as a response to the tax rate adjustment.	1	D-E-C-I-D-O-P-H-O-B-I-A, Decidophobia!<br/> See? I can pronounce it right!  <hr/> Praise the experiment designer, he made me so smart.	I'm happy to see that we are so grateful for the IRS's service.	No. This one is tricky. I hope you learnt something.		0	1	portrait-9.jpg				
15	YES, MINISTER	The Ministry of Social Security is considering a proposal to provide a new universal health insurance plan and raise the minimum wage to $10 per hour. <br/><br/> According to the minister <span class='keyword'>Plesto Muhani<span class='tooltip'>The minister of MSS, some people say he has 1/4 Gamanian ancestry</span></span>, the upcoming welfare policy is a strong fightback to those who keep slandering that the Experiment is the way to slavery - Has anyone seen such a slavery that offered its people so many welfares?	0	Hope my minimum monthly corpus supply can be increased too.	Shoot! What kind of minister is that?! <br/>Who would like more welfare?	No way! This welfare policy makes me feel sick.		0	1	portrait-8.jpg				
16	YES, MINISTER	Good news! The ex-Minister of Social Security Plesto Muhani was found guilty of being the spy for Gamania - our vicious neighbor. How despicable it is for a Gamanian to lurk in our public servants’ rank and pretend he is the guardian of the people? How dare he raise the welfare level without an experiment-proven scientific approach?  <br/><br/> The answer is not hard to find. Mr. Muhani confessed to the Federal Bureau of Experiments that the goal of his attempt to raise the welfare level is to serve as a foil to how ‘poor’ the current social welfare is.   <br/><br/>  Mr. Muhani is, perhaps the dumbest spy in this world. He stood out from us so obviously because everyone here knows that the current welfare standard is already beyond compare. The slightest attempt to raise it is the biggest insult to our great Experiment Designers.	1	Oh, I didn't expect we have a sequel.	I just know it. I had the hunch that he's a spy<br/> long before he was regarded as a spy.	What?! I thought it said GOOD news already.		0	1	portrait-7.jpg				
17	Прaвда	<span class='keyword'>Chrushkhev<span class='tooltip'>The Chief Experiment Scientist. He has been widely praised for his loyalty to our Experiment Designers since the foundation of our country. After all the original designers passed away, he became the actual leader. Nothing can be compared to his boundless wisdom</span></span> visited a pig farm and was photographed there. <br/><br/> In the newspaper office, a discussion is underway about how to caption the picture. "Comrade Chrushkhev among pigs," "Comrade Chrushkhev and pigs," and "Pigs surround comrade Chrushkhev" are all rejected as politically offensive.  <br/><br/> Finally, the editor announces his decision: <br/> "Third from left – comrade Chrushkhev."	0	To be clear, this is an indecent undergound paper<br/> and can only be used for experimental purpose.	Sure thing. I hope you have forgotten those disgusting words already.	You've made a HUGE mistake.				portrait-6.jpg
