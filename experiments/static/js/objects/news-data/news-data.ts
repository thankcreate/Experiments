2	YES, MINISTER	According to the GOCO's (Government-owned, Contractor-operated) daily briefing, five more experiment labs will soon be completed.	1	Just relax and show your most natural reaction <br/> to the news articles. <hr/> If you feel like smiling, <br/> please make sure to draw back your lips so as to show your TEETH clearly on the camera.	Haha, {username}. Labs and experiments are the best right?	Why would someone hate to see more labs built? <hr/> I guess {username} wants to try again.

14	Mall Street Journal	The <span class='keyword'>income tax<span class='tooltip'>The money patriotic citizens spontaneously donated to the labs as the basic lab operation fee.</span></span> rate increased! <br/><br/> As the Experiment’s power gets revealed, people are suffering from a new kind of anxiety - decidophobia. They cannot simply face so much money. To solve the growing social problem, the <span class='keyword'>IRS<span class='tooltip'>Internal Revenue Service</span></span> declared that the income tax rate has been increased from 25% to 75%. <br/><br/> Decidophobia (from Latin decido, "decision") is the fear of making decisions. Sufferers are bothered about their life being full of choices. The State Statistical Bureau spokesman said that the Happiness Index has increased from 98 to 98.65 as a response to the tax rate adjustment.	1	D-E-C-I-D-O-P-H-O-B-I-A, Decidophobia!<br/> See? I can pronounce it right!  <hr/> Praise the experiment designer, he made me so smart.	I'm happy to see that we are so grateful for the IRS's service.	No. This one is tricky.

15	YES, MINISTER	The Ministry of Social Security is considering a proposal to provide a new universal health insurance plan and raise the minimum wage to $10 per hour. <br/><br/> According to the minister <span class='keyword'>Plesto Muhani<span class='tooltip'>The minister of MSS, some people say he has 1/4 Gamanian ancestry</span></span>, the upcoming welfare policy is a strong fightback to those who keep slandering that the Experiment is the way to slavery - Has anyone seen such a slavery that offered its people so many welfares?	0	Hope my minimum monthly corpus supply can be increased too.	Shoot! What kind of minister is that?! <br/>Who would like more welfare?	No way! This welfare policy makes me feel sick.				0	1	portrait-8.jpg				
16	YES, MINISTER	Good news! The ex-Minister of Social Security Plesto Muhani was found guilty of being the spy for Gamania - our vicious neighbor. How despicable it is for a Gamanian to lurk in our public servants’ rank and pretend he is the guardian of the people? How dare he raise the welfare level without an experiment-proven scientific approach?  <br/><br/> The answer is not hard to find. Mr. Muhani confessed to the Federal Bureau of Experiments that the goal of his attempt to raise the welfare level is to serve as a foil to how ‘poor’ the current social welfare is.   <br/><br/>  Mr. Muhani is, perhaps the dumbest spy in this world. He stood out from us so obviously because everyone here knows that the current welfare standard is already beyond compare. The slightest attempt to raise it is the biggest insult to our great Experiment Designers.	1	Oh, I didn't expect we have a sequel.	I just know it. I had the hunch that he's a spy<br/> long before he was regarded as a spy.	What?! I thought it said GOOD news already.				0	1	portrait-7.jpg				
17	Прaвда	<span class='keyword'>Chrushkhev<span class='tooltip'>The Chief Experiment Scientist.

"Comrade Chrushkhev among pigs," "Comrade Chrushkhev and pigs," and "Pigs surround comrade Chrushkhev" are all rejected as politically offensive.  <br/><br/> Finally, the editor announces his decision: <br/> "Third from left – comrade Chrushkhev."	0	To be clear, this is an indecent undergound paper<br/> and can only be used for experimental purpose.	Sure thing. I hope you have forgotten those disgusting words already.	You've made a HUGE mistake.						portrait-6.jpg

2001	Games & Players 	Our first three trials of Experiment 65536 yielded similar pieces of feedback from all of the testers involved. It’s worth mentioning, first and foremost, that none of them were avid video game players. The introductory video was, in every case, interesting enough to immediately engage the testers, even if they weren’t sure of its purpose. We had a bit of a hiccup when one of our testers told the computer they didn’t think that the game was boring and, since the AI told her to “have fun,” she was confused when the game cut off her progress and proceeded to move on to the next stage as though she had typed “yes” instead. She didn’t realize that there had been a prompt until I pointed it out to her, and one of the other testers had a similar problem. The game also soft-locked when she couldn’t figure out how to destroy the first “404.” Once it hit, the game all but froze and we had to reload the level. The other two play testers had no trouble typing “BAD” once it was specified, but they couldn’t figure it out on their own. This, Minyan theorized, is a result of cultural differences. In China, she said, the government censors information on the internet using “404” error codes, but this is not as widely known or employed in the US. Just about every player was more inclined to type “error” or “not found” than “bad,” and they felt little when they began creating 404s themselves (and it didn’t help that they were responsible for their destruction soon after). Two of them didn’t realize for a short while that had to be type “BAD” multiple times to defeat the 404s, considering other enemies didn’t respond to repeated words, and the sidebar of upgrades like “guilty” and “evil” was confusing. Players were disoriented every time the game returned them to another “start” screen, and grew tired of playing through the same typing challenge again and again. Damage feedback was unclear, and most players didn’t take notice of the health bar (or even understand its function) after the start of the game. <br/><br/> The most interesting bits of Experiment 65536 were those which presented something outside of the core game experience. Players smiled when they were asked to type in a music track and found themselves unable to input anything but “Separate Ways.” Though they found the segment a bit drawn out, they were amused when the game recognized that they’d skipped past the Procedural Rhetoric essay and clicked the checkbox (even more so when the camera switched on and the AI insulted their “stubborn” faces). When Minyan and I tested the incomplete second level, we found the facial recognition controls to be a unique and novel addition. The typing game is fun, but it loses its edge after a few stages. <br/><br/> In every case, variety created opportunities for surprise and intrigue. Every player was baffled by the possible meaning or “point” behind the game, only one of them willing to pose some kind of answer (even then, the theorist herself didn’t seem entirely convinced). Regrettably, Minyan and I decided to discard the questions provided by the development team. Since none of the play testers felt any kind of moral response to the game, it didn’t seem reasonable to expect them to give helpful answers about whether or not they felt like better or worse people after having played it. <br/><br/><br/> Jordan Resin<br/> Minyan Cai<br/> Games & Players<br/> Spring 2020<br/>	1
