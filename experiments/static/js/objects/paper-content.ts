let paperContent = `I suggest the name procedural rhetoric for the practice of using processes persuasively, just as verbal rhetoric is the practice of using oratory persuasively and visual rhetoric is the prac-
tice of using images persuasively. 23 Procedural rhetoric is a general name for the practice of authoring arguments through processes. Following the classical model, procedural rhetoric
entails persuasion—to change opinion or action. Following the contemporary model, procedural rhetoric entails expression—to convey ideas effectively. Procedural rhetoric is a sub-
domain of procedural authorship; its arguments are made not through the construction of words or images, but through the authorship of rules of behavior, the construction of dy-
namic models. In computation, those rules are authored in code, through the practice of programming.
My rationale for suggesting a new rhetorical domain is very similar to the one that motivates visual rhetoricians. Just as photography, motion graphics, moving images, and illustra-
tions have become pervasive in contemporary society, so have computer hardware, software, and video games. Just as visual rhetoricians argue that verbal and written rhetorics inade-
quately account for the unique properties of the visual expression, so I argue that verbal, written, and visual rhetorics inadequately account for the unique properties of procedural
expression. A theory of procedural rhetoric is needed to make commensurate judgments about the software systems we encounter everyday and to allow a more sophisticated proce-
dural authorship with both persuasion and expression as its goal. As a high process intensity medium, video games can beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from a study of procedural rhetoric.
Procedural rhetoric affords a new and promising way to make claims about how things work. As I argued earlier, video games do not simply distract or entertain with empty, meaningless
content. Rather, video games can make claims about the world. But when they do so, they do it not with oral speech, nor in writing, nor even with images. Rather, video games
make argument with processes. Procedural rhetoric is the practice of effective persuasion and expression using processes. Since assembling rules together to describe the function
of systems produces procedural representation, assembling particular rules that suggest a particular function of a particular system characterizes procedural rhetoric.
