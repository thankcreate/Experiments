let paperContent = `I suggest the name procedural rhetoric for the practice of using processes persuasively, just as verbal rhetoric is the practice of using oratory persuasively and visual rhetoric is the practice of using images persuasively. Procedural rhetoric is a general name for the practice of authoring arguments through processes. Following the classical model, procedural rhetoric entails persuasion — to change opinion or action. Following the contemporary model, procedural rhetoric entails expression — to convey ideas effectively. Procedural rhetoric is a subdomain of procedural authorship; its arguments are made not through the construction of words or images, but through the authorship of rules of behavior, the construction of dynamic models. In computation, those rules are authored in code, through the practice of programming.

My rationale for suggesting a new rhetorical domain is very similar to the one that motivates visual rhetoricians. Just as photography, motion graphics, moving images, and illustrations have become pervasive in contemporary society, so have computer hardware, software, and video games. Just as visual rhetoricians argue that verbal and written rhetorics inadequately account for the unique properties of the visual expression, so I argue that verbal, written, and visual rhetorics inadequately account for the unique properties of procedural expression. A theory of procedural rhetoric is needed to make commensurate judgments about the software systems we encounter everyday and to allow a more sophisticated procedural authorship with both persuasion and expression as its goal. As a high process intensity medium, video games can beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from a study of procedural rhetoric.

Procedural rhetoric affords a new and promising way to make claims about how things work. As I argued earlier, video games do not simply distract or entertain with empty, meaningless content. Rather, video games can make claims about the world. But when they do so, they do it not with oral speech, nor in writing, nor even with images. Rather, video games make argument with processes. Procedural rhetoric is the practice of effective persuasion and expression using processes. Since assembling rules together to describe the function of systems produces procedural representation, assembling particular rules that suggest a particular function of a particular system characterizes procedural rhetoric.

I have argued for procedural rhetoric as a representational form, and as the speciﬁc communication practice at work in games like Animal Crossing and The McDonald’s Videogame. But to use games for learning purposes requires general approaches that might be applied to many games and many subjects. As such, it is worth sketching a few of the different ways video games can be used rhetorically, whether for design, critique, or learning.

One use of procedural rhetoric is to expose and explain the hidden ways of thinking that often drive social, political, or cultural behavior. We often call such logics ideology, a term with a long and conﬂicted intellectual history. In Plato’s famous parable of the cave in the Republic, humans’ understanding of the world is likened to prisoners watching shadows cast on the wall of a cave by objects and agents passing above. The prisoners see only a ﬂawed shadow of the ideal form of the object. For Plato, the disparity between the ideal and material realms can only be reconciled through a recollection of the forms, a claim that assumes that our souls were once connected to these forms and, therefore, are also immortal. 

Like all cultural artifacts, no video game is produced in a cultural vacuum. All bear the biases of their creators. Video games can help shed light on these ideological biases. Sometimes these biases are inadvertent and deeply hidden. Other times, the artifacts themselves hope to expose their creators’ biases as positive ones, but which of course can then be read in support or opposition.
